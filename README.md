# ArchRBStealth
My scripts to install Arch on my Razer Blade Stealth

Just got it to replace my dying MBP, so I'm moving my shit here.

I only use this to make reinstalling arch great again. For myself. By myself. If you want to use it, you'll probably want to change literally everything because this makes things just how I want them... like with my user name and the packages I like.

I'll try to keep my own shit like KDE and stuff separate from the necessary stuff like drivers so, if you want to fork it and improve it you can. I've seen people do this with PKGBUILDs, but I'm trying to stick with bash/zsh.
